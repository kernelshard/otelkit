```bash
# Requires Docker for OTLP collectors
make integration-up
make test-integration
make integration-down
```

#### Code Quality
```bash
make fmt      # Format code
make lint     # Lint code (requires golangci-lint)

### Pull Request Process

1. Ensure all tests pass
2. Update documentation if needed
3. Add a clear description of changes
4. Reference any related issues
5. Request review from maintainers

## Code Style Guidelines

### Go Code
- Follow standard Go formatting (`gofmt`)
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add comments for exported functions and types
- Keep functions focused and concise

### Documentation
- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add godoc comments for all exported elements
- Include examples for new features

### Testing
- Write tests for new functionality
- Maintain high test coverage
- Include both unit and integration tests
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate

## Adding New Features

### Feature Proposal
Before implementing major features, please:
1. Open an issue to discuss the feature
2. Get feedback from maintainers
3. Outline the implementation approach

### Backward Compatibility
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Use semantic versioning for breaking changes
- Provide migration guides for major changes

## Bug Reports

When reporting bugs, please include:
- OtelKit version
- Go version
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Relevant logs or error messages

## Release Process

Releases follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

1. **Patch releases** (x.x.1): Bug fixes
2. **Minor releases** (x.1.x): New features, backward compatible
3. **Major releases** (1.x.x): Breaking changes

### Release Steps
1. Update version in relevant files
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create release tag
4. Build and test release artifacts
5. Publish release notes
